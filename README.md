# AvidemuxIDX2FileMaker
This repository contains code written in Java to help use the program Avidemux.  

When using Avidemux to edit video files a IDX2 file is created to store information about the video file.  

Sometimes Avidemux will get hung up on creating the IDX2 file and then crash.  

This code is designed to take in a directory location and then create a IDX2 file for every file in the directory.  

Doing this independent of Avidemux prevents crashes and allows you to go straight to video editing.
